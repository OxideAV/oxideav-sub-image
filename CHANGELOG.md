## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `composite` module with a Porter–Duff source-over (`over`) primitive
  and an alpha-aware `blit_indexed` helper. Overlapping subtitle objects
  whose topmost pixel is partially transparent now blend over earlier
  canvas content instead of hard-overwriting it. PGS and DVB-subtitle
  render paths route their blits through the shared compositor.
